//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendsName = ["Aamir", "Amjad", "Adnan", "Ammad", "Arsalan", "Humayun", "Saad", "Faizan"];

for (let i = 0; i < friendsName.length; i++){
   
    console.log("Hey, " + friendsName[i] + " how are you and your family?");
}
