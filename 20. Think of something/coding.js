// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries = ["Saudi Arab", "Switzerland", "Japan", "Turkey", "Norway"];
let cities = ["Mecca", "Zurich", "Tokyo", "Istanbul", "Oslo"];
let languages = ["Arabic", "Italian", "Japanese", "Turkish", "Norwegian"];

// Countries list:
console.log("Countries list:");
console.log(countries);

// Cities list:
console.log("Cities list:");
console.log(cities);

// Languages list:
console.log("Languages list:");
console.log(languages);
